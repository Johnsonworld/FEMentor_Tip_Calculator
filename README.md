## My process

Started with mobile first workflow, framed that in, added content, formatted, then used Javascript behind the scenes.  Then using media queries, added responive design for desktop screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript


### What I learned

More insight into positioning with Grid & Flexbox.  Also, utilized Javascript more extensively as I used radio buttons for the tip % selectors.  This project helped me better understand the use of HTML DOM selectors and methods. I was able to accomplish what I wanted to, even if the code itself was not as elegant or encapsulated as I would have liked.

I am getting much better with HTML & CSS understanding - particularly framing in the document flow in advance of adding content.  Saves a lot of time and heartache.


### Continued development

This project highlighted the need for further practice and experimentation with the following:

- Code efficiency and formatting - Javascript flow.
- Iterating arrays and objects.
